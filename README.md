# Background
I am planning bus routes for a project in the Wupenicity International Survey Competition (Traffic). Despite searching online, I have not found any open-source projects for traffic evacuation problems. I aim to develop a new algorithm to solve various optimization problems for central point evacuation using the radiating routes model, especially those involving thousands of points.
